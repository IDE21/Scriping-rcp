This new quartz model adopts a sophisticated art deco appeal with an elongated rectangular face and slim 6.25 mm case. This is our shallowest case design to date which gives a very sleek profile to this watch. 
The design is available in five variations that alternate either in two-tone, gold-tone and stainless steel. The face comes in combinations of black roman numerals on a crisp white dial or alternating gold & diamond indexes on a mother-of-pearl face.
The sapphire crystal window is framed by a beveled rectangular case. The tiered design gives this watch an illusion of depth without the thickness. The watch is completed with our logo’s signature upon the crown. 
Unlike the classic round ladies’ toccata, this watch manages to nail a refined, retro aesthetic all the while remaining true to the Swiss craftsmanship and inspiration behind the collection.

With limited availability worldwide, the timepiece pays homage to the iconic contemporary artist, a visionary whose profound influence continues to resonate throughout the worlds of art and culture.
The new freelancer Basquiat timepiece is a true collectors’ item showcasing Basquiat’s artwork on the exterior and the artistry of Swiss watchmaking within.
A color palette dominated by the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue has been set against a black background to ensure the legibility of all horological functions. At the heart of the dial sits the iconic ‘Pez Dispenser’, the crown-wearing dinosaur depicted in Basquiat’s famous painting of 1984. Positioned at 12 o’clock, the unmistakable crown boasts a yellow Super-Luminova® embellishment, while the hour hands and indexes are dressed in white Super-LumiNova®, emitting a glow under dim light conditions.
The sleek black PVD pushers are emblazoned with Basquiat’s iconic symbols; the Copyright symbol on the Cancel/Reset pusher; the Dollar sign on the Start/Stop pusher and the artist’s signature crown motif on the screwed-down crown. The watch highlights a ceramic tachymeter bezel, designed for precise measurement, alongside a flange pulsometer scale calibrated for 30 pulsations.
The bi-compax chronograph recessed counters and skeleton discs carry artistic depth. Located at 9 o’clock, the forever turning seconds’ disc has been covered with a concentric spiral as a metaphor for Basquiat’s personal reflections and life’s complexity. Positioned opposite, the 30-minute jumping disc depicts three of his core painting themes of life, death, and humanity.
The see-through sapphire crystal case back, subtly enhanced by a discreet blue gasket, provides a captivating view of the mechanical bi-compax chronograph self-winding movement. At the heart of this timepiece lies Basquiat’s signature, merging seamlessly with the W-shaped oscillating weight, RAYMOND WEIL’s horological signature.
The titanium case marries design and function, sized at 43.5mm diameter and 13.7mm thickness for comfortable wear.","Titanium, Black Ceramic Tachymeter Bezel, Basquiat’s Artwork, Black Leather Strap"

The symmetrical bi-compax layout features a 30-minute chronograph counter and a small seconds display.

The hour track is snailed, while the hands and indexes feature luminescent treatment, improving readability in restricted light.
This dial wonderfully plays with colour, depths and textures, creating a subtle, sophisticated appearance. The chronograph seconds hand, counters and the pulsometer scale are all presented in shades of turquoise. A date display is positioned at 6 o’clock with a black date disc, matching the colour of the dial.

The dial, located beneath a vintage-inspired sapphire crystal glass-box, has been refined to the highest degree. The hours and minutes are eloquently conveyed with silver-toned hands, lined with Super-LumiNova®. The sector dial presents the hours, minutes and seconds periods on discrete tracks, augmenting readability.
A closer inspection of the dial reveals contrasting finishes, the hour track is smooth, the minute track is snailed and the central area of the dial is adorned with a delicate vertical brush. The millesime features a small seconds display at 6 o’clock, delineated with a neat recessed circlet, introducing a seemly play with depths, which is enriched with a tasteful selection of details.
The bezel is decorated with a vertical satin-brush that contrasts wonderfully with the highly polished bevel nearby. This juxtaposition of two finishes reinforces the overall level of finishing.
A sapphire caseback affords sight of the self-winding movement within and the “W-shaped” oscillating weight, RAYMOND WEIL’s horological signature. The genuine calf leather strap is enhanced with a unique W-stitched detail.

RAYMOND WEIL unveils the new freelancer bi-compax chronograph 7780, an eye-catching vintage-inspired watch perfectly suited to free thinkers and creative individuals.
The RAYMOND WEIL freelancer Chronograph 7780 is available in two variants: one with a bronze case and orange accents, limited to just 300 pieces, and this model, the reference 7780-tb3-20423, with a bronze and titanium case and blue accents.
The symmetrical bi-compax layout features a 30-minute chronograph counter and a small seconds display. The golden hour and minute hands are generously proportioned and, in conjunction with the applied indexes, prove highly legible. The hour track is snailed, while the hands and indexes feature luminescent treatment, augmenting readability in restricted light. The colour of the central chronograph seconds hand, the hand on the 30-minute register and the numerals on the pulsometer scale are all presented in blue shades.
A date display is positioned at 6 o’clock, once again contributing to the overall symmetry of the dial. The date disc is presented in black, matching the colour of the dial, a detail much appreciated by watch enthusiasts. The tachymeter scale, presented on the bezel, provides the means to determine the speed of a motorbike, or vehicle of your choice, over a known distance. Residing on a golden-toned flange, a pulsometer scale allows the wearer to determine the heart rate of an individual. A notable characteristic of this dial is that it wonderfully plays with shades, depths and textures, contributing to the watch’s sophisticated appearance.
The movement, the Calibre RW5030, is visible via the exhibition case back. Once again, the attention to detail is clear to see. For example, the watch is fitted with a W-shaped skeleton oscillating weight, a reference to the founder’s surname. A further attribute of this automatic movement is that assuming the mainspring is fully wound, the watch will run autonomously for 56 hours. The watch comes on a black calf leather strap. It is enlivened with contrasting stitching and paired with a titanium folding clasp equipped with a double push-security system.","Stainless Steel Case, black ceramic bezel, black dial, black leather strap"

Capable of displaying two time zones simultaneously, the freelancer GMT is 40.5mm in diameter and has a thickness of 9.7mm. The case features two angled crowns: the upper crown at 2 o’clock serves to wind the barrel and adjust the various time indications, while the crown at 4 o’clock, sporting the Swiss flag on its flank, adjusts the GMT hand.
The use of progressive shades of blue in the dial makes this watch a bewitching composition. At the base of it, just above 6 o’clock, a rectangular aperture reveals the date. Presented in white numerals sat atop a blue disc, the colour of the date disc matches the dial, upholding horological etiquette. A 24-hour track is presented on the dial flange and is used in conjunction with the GMT hand to indicate whether the ‘home time’ is day or night. Nocturnal hours are expressed using white numerals set against a blue background, while daytime hours are shown in blue against a white backdrop. A crescent shaped moon denotes the midnight hour. Barrel shaped hour and minute hands collaborate with applied indexes, denoting the ‘local time’. A darkly attired GMT hand, endowed with a prominent triangular red and white tip, succinctly displays the hour at home. A slender silver-toned central sweep seconds hand, fitted with a highly legible lollipop, completes the suite of hands displayed. Both the hands and indexes are treated with Super-LumiNova®, ensuring readability even in dim light.
Located at the heart of the freelancer GMT is the new Calibre RW3230, a Swiss automatic movement with a power reserve of 50 hours. Measuring just 4.1mm in height, its slender profile contributes to the model’s elegant appearance.

A unique piece from our history that feels all the more special today.  A decade since its initial release, the Don Giovanni Così Grande is being released from our vault as a limited edition, available exclusively online at the RAYMOND WEIL e-boutique. 
 We find this piece during a time when we need stability more than ever. It is a symbol of endurance as time is our constant. Its regulator design shows how style perseveres and the automatic movement will always continue to tick on into the future. 
The robust rectangular layout measures a generous 50 x 38 mm in case size, with two offset dials. The top reading minutes with a unique visual perspective drawing your eye to an hour window located at the top of the face. The bottom dial contains the running seconds indication. The figure-eight dial layout is complemented by the organic curves of the stainless steel case. 
The hour display is known as a “jumping hour”. This means that the hour hand is replaced by a large analog window, located at 12 o’clock, for an extraordinary reading of time. This feature is built around the powerful Calibre RW 1400 mechanical movement. At each full hour, the disc mechanism instantly “jumps” to the following hour, which appears in the window.
This RAYMOND WEIL interpretation of the regulator is heavily embedded in functionality and accuracy. It is a style that proves its dependability throughout life’s time trials. So we count forwards and dare to “jump” into tomorrow.",
